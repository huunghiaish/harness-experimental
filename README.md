# harness-experimental

## Current State

This repository is in Harness v0.

There is no application implementation and no baked-in product specification
yet. The current work is the reusable project harness: the file structure,
agent operating model, feature intake process, story templates, and validation
expectations that help humans and agents turn a future user-provided spec into
implementation work.

## Product Sources

No product contract is currently defined.

When a user provides a project specification, add or reference it as the input
spec for the first buildout, then derive smaller living artifacts from it:

- `docs/product/`: current product contract files, created from the spec.
- `docs/stories/`: story packets and backlog created from selected work.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`: behavior-to-proof control panel.
- `docs/decisions/`: durable decisions and tradeoffs.

Do not keep a project-specific spec or product breakdown in this harness until
a real project supplies one.

## Harness Sources

- `AGENTS.md`: agent entrypoint and operating rules.
- `docs/HARNESS.md`: human-agent collaboration model.
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`: tiny, normal, and high-risk work classification.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: generic architecture discovery and boundary rules.
- `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`: proposed harness improvements.
- `docs/playbooks/`: reusable recipes for recurring tooling, environment, and
  workflow problems. Read before fighting a familiar symptom.
- `docs/templates/`: reusable spec-intake, story, decision, and validation
  templates.

## Working Rule

Implementation prompts do not go straight to code. They first pass through
feature intake, become story-sized work when needed, and then carry both
product validation and harness maintenance expectations.

## Greenfield Bootstrap (from a SPEC.md)

For a brand-new project starting from a written specification:

```bash
# 1. Clone the harness skeleton into a fresh directory
git clone https://github.com/huunghiaish/harness-experimental.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git && git init

# 2. Place the spec at the canonical greenfield location
cp /path/to/your-spec.md ./SPEC.md
```

3. Open Claude Code (or any agent that reads `AGENTS.md`) and prompt:

   > Read SPEC.md. Run Phase 1 Spec Intake per docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md.
   > Create docs/spec-intake.md. Stop after intake for human review.

4. Approve the intake (see `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` § Spec Approval
   Gate). Only then does the agent derive `docs/product/*`, architecture
   decisions, design-direction decisions, and first story packets.

5. From there, the agent follows the full Task Loop in `AGENTS.md` per
   story.

The `--bootstrap` mode of `install-harness.sh` is not yet implemented;
see `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`. Until then, the manual clone above is
the supported greenfield path.

## Install Harness Into A Project

From a target project directory, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huunghiaish/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes
```

If the target already has `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/`, choose one:

```bash
# Keep existing files and add only missing Harness files
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huunghiaish/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --merge --yes

# Back up and replace AGENTS.md, docs/, and scripts/
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huunghiaish/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --override --yes
```

Or install into a specific path:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huunghiaish/harness-experimental/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --directory /path/to/project --yes
```

If the target already contains `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/`, interactive
installs ask whether to `1. Merge`, `2. Override`, or `3. Stop`. Non-interactive
installs using `--yes` stop before writing unless `--merge` or `--override` is
provided. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes. The installer itself and this
repository's installer story are not copied into the target project.
