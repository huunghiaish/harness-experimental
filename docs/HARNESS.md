# Harness

The project goal is to provide a reusable operating harness that lets humans and
agents turn a future product spec into safe, validated work.

The app is what users touch. The harness is what agents touch.

```

Every task has two possible outputs:

1. Product delta: app code, tests, API shape, data model, or product docs.
2. Harness delta: docs, templates, validation expectations, backlog items,
   decision records, or **playbook entries** that make the next task easier.

Playbooks are the cross-project memory layer of the harness — each entry
turns a one-time fix into a portable recipe, so a sibling project running the
same Harness installer inherits the answer instead of re-deriving it.

## Independence Principle

The harness operating model must function with only:

- An agent capable of reading and writing files plus running shell commands
  (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, or a human reading the docs).
- Git and bash (for `scripts/install-harness.sh`).

ClaudeKit (CK), `claudekit-custom`, and any other skill layer are **optional
convenience** that may speed up execution but must never be a hard runtime
dependency. References to those skills are tooling hints, not requirements.

Specifically:

- `AGENTS.md`, `HARNESS.md`, `FEATURE_INTAKE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
  `scripts/install-harness.sh` MUST NOT reference an external skill as a
  required step.
- Playbooks and templates MAY recommend external skills (e.g.
  `/ck:web-testing`, `/ck:ai-multimodal`) as optional tooling hints. The
  core logic of every playbook must be executable without those skills —
  the recommendation is enrichment, not gating.
- Plans and phase files MAY reference skim research in external repos
  (e.g. `~/Projects/claudekit-custom/skills/...`). Each phase must include
  a draft skeleton sufficient for execution without skim. The skim is
  enrichment, never a blocker.

When an agent finds a playbook, template, or plan that violates this
principle (e.g. mandates a skill install before execution), treat it as a
defect — refactor the file or open a `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md` entry.

## Harness v0 Scope

Harness v0 includes:

- Agent entrypoint.
- Empty product documentation structure.
- Feature intake and risk lanes.
- Story templates.
- Decision log template.
- Validation report template.
- Test matrix placeholder.
- Harness growth backlog.
- Playbooks folder for reusable cross-project recipes.

Harness v0 deliberately excludes:

- A project-specific `SPEC.md`.
- Pre-sliced product domains.
- A locked application stack.
- App source scaffolding.
- Package scripts.
- Test runner config.
- CI workflows.
- Database migrations or infrastructure.

Those should arrive only when a selected story needs them.

## Source Hierarchy

```text
User-provided spec or prompt
  input material for first buildout or future changes

docs/product/*
  current product contract derived from accepted input

docs/stories/*
  story-sized work packets and historical evidence

docs/TEST_MATRIX.md
  behavior-to-proof control panel

docs/decisions/*
  why the contract changed
```

Before implementation, product docs describe intent. After implementation,
product docs plus executable tests become the living contract.

## Traceability Tokens

The harness uses prefixed IDs so that requirements, scenarios, tests, and
stories can be cross-referenced by `grep` across `docs/`. Token format follows
three rules:

1. **Top-level IDs keep their existing form.** Stories use `US-NNN`
   (e.g. `US-014`), epics use `E0X-kebab-name` (e.g. `E02-access-control`),
   decisions use `NNNN` 4-digit without prefix (e.g. `0004`). Do not rename
   them.
2. **Sub-story IDs use composite form** `US-NNN.PREFIX-MMM` where PREFIX is
   one of:

   | Prefix | Means | Lives in |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | REQ | A discrete requirement inside a story | story packet |
   | SC | A scenario / edge case to prove | scenario notes or test plan |
   | TC | A test case (manual or automated) | TEST_MATRIX row, test file name |

   Example: `US-014.REQ-001`, `US-014.SC-003`, `US-014.TC-007`. Composite
   scope keeps numbering local to the story (no cross-story counter to
   manage) and forces `grep` callers to cite the full composite for audit.
3. **TEST_MATRIX rows cite the token they prove.** Any row in
   `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` must reference at least one composite token in its
   Contract column.

Per-lane application:

| Lane | Token use |
| --- | --- |
| Tiny | Optional. Inline narrative is fine. |
| Normal | Required for any new requirement or scenario the story introduces. |
| High-risk | Required. Every entry in `execplan.md`, `design.md`, `validation.md` must reference its tokens. |

Reject `STR-` and `DEC-` prefixes — `US-` and 4-digit decision numbering
already cover those concepts.

## Playbook Lifecycle

Every playbook carries a lifecycle status so readers know whether the
guidance has been exercised on real work or is still a paper proposal.
Status appears as a single line near the top of the playbook (under the
title, before the first section).

```markdown
**Lifecycle:** experimental · **First use:** TBD · **Verified by:** none
```

States:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `experimental` | Shipped but not yet exercised on a real story. Treat as proposal. |
| `verified` | Used on at least one real story with no Variant amendment required. Safe to follow as-is. |
| `deprecated` | Superseded by a newer playbook, or accumulated 2+ Variant amendments without convergence. Do not start new work from it. |

Promotion / demotion:

- `experimental` → `verified`: 1 story used the playbook successfully
  without needing a Variant section, OR 2 stories used it (Variant
  sections may exist if they describe minor edge cases).
- `verified` → `deprecated`: superseded by a newer file, OR 2+ Variant
  sections accumulated that point to systemic issues.

Update the `First use` and `Verified by` fields when promoting. Keep the
line as a single grep-able sentence so `grep -l "experimental" docs/playbooks/`
returns the current candidate set.

## Spec Lifecycle

Harness v0 starts without a tracked project spec. When the human provides a
specification, treat it as input material, not as a permanent operating manual.
Use it to populate product docs, story packets, architecture decisions, and
validation expectations during the first buildout.

If the spec ships **UI surfaces** (web, mobile, desktop, or any visual
interface), the first buildout must also produce `docs/design-guidelines.md`
following `docs/playbooks/ui-design-system-contract.md`. The contract file
is a first-class derived artifact alongside product docs — without it,
every page re-invents the visual layer and drift compounds quickly. Stub
the §3 Component Coverage Matrix from day one even if most rows are TODO;
the gap should be visible.

After the specification has been decomposed, do not keep extending it as the
living product plan. Ongoing work should update the smaller product docs,
stories, test matrix, and decision records.

Ongoing work should enter the harness as one of these input types:

- New spec: a project specification that needs to become product docs and
  initial story candidates.
- Spec slice: a selected behavior from the provided spec.
- Change request: a bounded behavior change, bug fix, or product refinement.
- New initiative: a larger product area that needs multiple stories.
- Maintenance request: dependency, architecture, performance, security, or
  operational work.
- Harness improvement: a process, template, proof, or agent-instruction change.

The spec-to-work loop is:

```text
human intent or supplied spec
  -> classify input type
  -> update or create product contract
  -> create story packet or initiative notes when needed
  -> define validation proof
  -> implement or document the blocker
  -> update product docs, stories, test matrix, and decisions
  -> capture harness friction
```

Large product areas should use scoped initiative notes instead of a second
monolithic specification. An initiative should explain the goal, affected
product docs, candidate stories, validation shape, open decisions, and exit
criteria. If initiative work becomes a repeated pattern, add a template or
proposal to `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Growth Rule

The harness grows from friction.

When an agent is confused, repeats manual reasoning, needs a new validation
command, discovers a missing rule, or sees a recurring failure pattern, it must
either improve the harness directly or add a proposal to `HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Project Doc Mapping

Some agent-orchestration setups (e.g. user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) expect a fixed set of project docs at the root of `docs/`. Harness organises the same information differently. The table below maps the expected docs to the harness-equivalent source(s). Agents working under both rules should follow the harness layout — the mapped harness docs ARE the project doc.

| Expected doc | Harness equivalent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/project-overview-pdr.md` | `docs/HARNESS.md` + `docs/product/*` | Operating model + current product contract together replace a PDR. |
| `docs/system-architecture.md` | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/decisions/*` | Generic boundary rules + dated architecture decisions. |
| `docs/project-roadmap.md` | `docs/stories/backlog.md` (ordering) + epics in `docs/stories/epics/` | Roadmap = ordered story queue. |
| `docs/project-changelog.md` | `git log` + `docs/decisions/*` | Reconstruct from commit history and dated decisions. Generate on demand. |
| `docs/codebase-summary.md` | Generated on demand (e.g. `/ck:docs` skill) | Skip until an agent asks; treat as derived, not durable. |
| `docs/design-guidelines.md` | `docs/design-guidelines.md` (derived at stage 5 via `ui-design-system-contract.md` playbook) | Same name — already a first-class harness artifact for UI projects. |
| `docs/code-standards.md` | `docs/code-standards.md` (derived at stage 5 from `docs/templates/code-standards.md` after stack-selection decision) | Stub ships in templates; project fills in after stack picked. |
| `docs/deployment-guide.md` | `docs/deployment-guide.md` (derived at stage 12 from `docs/templates/deployment-guide.md` at first release) | Stub ships in templates; project fills in when first deploy happens. |

When in doubt: the harness layout wins. If a tool or rule demands one of the expected paths and the harness equivalent is enough, create a single-line redirect file rather than duplicating content.

## Future Validation Ladder

No validation scripts exist yet. When implementation begins, the expected ladder
is:

```text
validate:quick
  format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, architecture check

test:integration
  backend, database, provider, or service checks as the stack requires

test:e2e
  user-visible end-to-end flows

test:platform
  shell, mobile, desktop, or deployment smoke checks as the stack requires

test:release
  full suite, log checks, and performance smoke
```

Agents must not claim these commands pass until they exist and have been run.
